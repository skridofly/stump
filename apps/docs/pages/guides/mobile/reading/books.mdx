The EPUB reader in Stump's mobile app is powered by Readium, providing a native reading experience for digital books. While still being refined, it offers essential reading functionality with customizable themes and settings.

## Layout and Navigation

The EPUB reader features a clean, minimal interface that focuses on the reading experience:

- **Center Tap**: Tap the center of the screen to show/hide the reader controls
- **Header Controls**: Exit the reader and access quick settings
- **Footer Controls**: Progress indicator and navigation tools

## Reader Settings

The EPUB reader provides several customization options accessible through the settings panel:

### Visual Themes

The reader includes several built-in themes for different reading preferences:

- **Light**: Standard light theme with black text on white background
- **Dark**: Dark theme for low-light reading
- **Sepia**: Warm sepia tones for reduced eye strain
- **Custom Themes**: Create and customize your own color schemes

### Font Configuration

#### Font Size

Adjust the text size with a slider control to find the most comfortable reading size for your device and preferences.

#### Font Family

Choose from several default fonts optimized for reading:

- **System**: Use your device's default font
- **OpenDyslexic**: Designed to improve readability for people with dyslexia
- **Literata**: A serif font optimized for digital reading
- **Atkinson Hyperlegible**: Designed for enhanced legibility and accessibility
- **Charis SIL**: A Unicode-based font family supporting a wide range of languages
- **Bitter**: A slab serif font designed for comfortable screen reading

#### Line Height

Adjust the spacing between lines of text for improved readability and comfort.

### Display Settings

#### Brightness Control

Fine-tune the screen brightness directly within the reader without affecting your device's global brightness setting.

#### Publisher Styles

Toggle whether to respect the original formatting and styles defined by the book's publisher, or use your custom theme settings throughout.

## Navigation Features

### Table of Contents

Access the book's table of contents to jump to specific chapters or sections. The table of contents preserves the hierarchical structure of the book.

### Book Overview

View book metadata including:

- Cover image
- Title and author information
- Publisher details
- Book summary (when available)

## Progress Tracking

Your reading progress is automatically saved and synced across devices when connected to a Stump server.

Like the image-based reader, the EPUB reader also supports:

- **Incognito Mode**: Read without saving progress or location data
- **Reading Timer**: Track time spent reading (with sync support for Stump servers)
