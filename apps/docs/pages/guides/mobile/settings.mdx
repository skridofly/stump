# App Settings

The mobile app provides comprehensive settings to customize your reading experience and app behavior. These settings are stored locally on your device and are not synced across devices.

## Preferences

### Theme

A light and dark theme is available by default. The [ebook reader](/guides/mobile/reading/books#visual-themes) has more options available.

### Accent Color (iOS only)

Customize the app's accent color using a color picker. This affects buttons and other interactive elements throughout the app.

### Language

<Callout emoji="🚧" type="warning">
	Currently, only English is supported. Additional languages are planned for future releases.
</Callout>

Configure the app's display language.

### Default Server

Quick access to switch between your configured servers. See the [default server](/guides/mobile/servers#default-server) guide for more information about server management.

### Thumbnail Ratio

Choose how book covers and thumbnails are displayed:

- **1 : 1.6** - Taller, an uncommon but standard ebook aspect ratio
- **1 : 1.5** - Default, the standard aspect ratio for western books and American comics
- **1 : √2** - Shorter, another common aspect ratio for books and the standard aspect ratio for Japanese manga

## Reading

### Reader Settings

Access comprehensive reader configuration options. This opens a dedicated settings screen where you can configure:

- Global reading preferences
- Font and display settings
- Navigation controls
- Per-format reader options

These settings serve as defaults for all books and can be overridden on a per-book basis.

## Stump Integration

You do not need a Stump server to use the app. Any OPDS v2-compatible server will work for basic catalog browsing and reading.

When disabled, the app simply hides any Stump-specific features:

- Only OPDS servers may be configured
- Only OPDS servers are shown during server selection

A few important notes when Stump features are disabled:

- Existing Stump servers will still be stored, but hidden from view
- You won't get progress syncing, since that relies on Stump-specific APIs
- Your OPDS server **must** support sending a `readingOrder` for publications if you want streaming support

## Management

### Data Usage

<Callout emoji="🚧" type="warning">
	This functionality is not fully implemented yet and may change in future releases
</Callout>

Monitor and manage the app's storage usage with detailed breakdowns:

- **Total Usage**: Overall storage consumed by the app
- **Per-Server Data**: Usage categorized by each configured server
- **Data Categories**: Downloads, cached images, preferences, and temporary files

## Debug & Privacy

### Image Cache Management

Clear cached images to free up storage space:

- **Memory Cache**: Clear images stored in RAM for current session
- **Disk Cache**: Clear permanently cached images stored on device

### Reduce Animations

Toggle to minimize or disable animations throughout the app. Useful for:

- Improving performance on older devices
- Reducing motion for accessibility
- Conserving battery life

### Mask URLs

Privacy feature that obscures server URLs in the interface. This was added to help with debugging while ensuring that potentially sensitive information is not inadvertently shared
